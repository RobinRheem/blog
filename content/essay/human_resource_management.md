Summary: The HR team have a hard time trying to manage company members. While the company member will have their own problems in the company.

# Human Resource Management
I always like human resource managers.
They're very kind in a way, and very unkind too.
In a company that doesn't have money, HR teams tend to be unkind.
On the other hand, when the company actually has a lot of money, HR teams tend to be kind.
I think the main factor is how much money the company has in where the HR team are kind or not.
I always wondered why companies don't really give much money to the HR team.
After all, they're actually the company-wide human resource managers.
If they do their job well, I think a lot of the company members will be able to work in a better environment.

## Managers
What I observed from HR managers are, they try a lot.
They make perks and some PR stuff so that great people could get interested in the company.
They give out their job descriptions to head hunters and they even go out to the wild and try to find people.
After all that hard work, they make an on-boarding process for the newcomers.
They give them a welcome kit, and try to explain all the core values and the culture of the company.
Also some stuff like how to use the perks, where the bathroom is, who to ask for what, and etc.

The hard part is, there's not much of a piece of software that either automates or helps HR managers.
Of course there are internal tools for each company, but there doesn't seem to be a universal one.
What I mean is, things like commute tracking, conference room scheduling, government paperwork stuff that the company does for employees,
all kinds of software signups like Slack, Microsoft Office, Google Suite, and etc, company property management, and even expense tracking.
There are so many things that should be helped for HR managers.
But there are so many companies that don't try to help!

## As a company member
Before I become a company member, I mostly have to go through the interview process that's initiated by the recruiter, head hunter, or my network.
The interview process actually shows the culture of the company.
So I pretty much get a peak of it.
When I get in, the onboarding begins. 
I get to know the people around me, the team, the executives, the company culture, rules, and etc.
Now it's time to setup my computer.
I go and signup for all the things that I need(there are some rare companies that actually automate this process).
When I need to go on vacation, I go into a website or some sort of software and process it.
When I need to schedule a conference room I have to go into another website or some sort of software again.
There was not company that I saw that had everything for a company member in one place.
It was all scattered around and never organized.
Basically, the internal software isn't implemented in care.
The surprising thing that I saw was, software engineers don't tend to like implementing internal tools.
Those tools are actually really crucial, but they want to implement the so called 'main' service.
If it were Google, it would be the search engine algorithm.
I just love helping people that are around me.
That's why I loved implementing administration and internal tools.
Of course it's a lie if I ever liked it from the start.
I got to love it more when I actually saw the reactions of the people who use it.
Making their life easier was a breath-taking moment for me.

## Conclusion
Why isn't there a company out there that creates all the needed, universal internal tools?
I think it's something that can be generalized. 
And if it needed some customization, why not make an app store system like Slack?
From all the waste of every company trying to implement the same tools all over again,
and letting the software engineers get to focus on their 'main' service, would be a great thing to happen.
I think I might be a great fit actually.
I just hope that there's a lot of people out there that actually think like me!

## Edit 1
What if there was a central user management system?
G Suite could do this, but for other internal tools, you need another internal user management system.
So it only has company members in it.
In most companies the internal tools are really scattered around.
Why not make a portal website for internal tools for a company?
If I want to make a conference schedule, I go to the portal and then do it there.
If I want to tell others that I'm going vacation, I just go to the portal and then find it there.
We could also implement all the shortcuts for this as a Slack app so everything can be automated.
Making all this automated is actually a really important thing.
Also giving shortcuts for the tools they use.
If they use JIRA or Confluence, you just put a link on the internal tool portal.
Anything that you want to share to the whole company without alerting them too much, just make a nice notice board!
How about if you're a mananger?
Team managing tools in the job portal!
Seeing when people came, going to go, all that good stuff.
Maybe put in data visualization tools for the whole company.
There'll be more and more things in the portal site, but it'll help everyone to get around the massive company, if it gets that massive.
Even if it's a startup, everything shouldn't be scattered around.
If you make something that's only done in the internal side, why not just link it to the portal?

In summary, what if there was an internal portal site?

* Central user management system that integrates with G Suite and other stuff etc.
* Notice board for all company members to see.
* Commute management system.
* Conference room/call scheduling system(automatically update to calendar!).
* A list of links for external tools like JIRA, Confluence, or maybe GitHub Enterprise and etc. 
* A Slack app that does the same thing.
* Money management system.
* Digital signing and printing for important documents system.
* A dashboard that shows all the key metrics of the company.

And more!
Of course more features will be updated, and they'll be from the users.
Helping all non-tech people that are in the tech industry.
But what would be the most essential thing in here?
I think it would be the central user management system, or the portal site.
But of course, both need eachother.
So I guess I'll have to get to think what's more important.
