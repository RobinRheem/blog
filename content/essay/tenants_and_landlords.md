Summary: My observations between tenants and landlords who have pleanty of problems for themselves, and from eachother.

# Tenants and Landlords
I've always been a tenant, and I think I'll be one for a long time because of high housing prices.
But there are times when I get curious of how a landlord would live.
The people I see tend to think that being a landlord is very easy.
Because they just rent out their space and get money monthly doing nothing.

## Landlords
The thing is, a landlord is harder than we think.
They have various tasks such as, getting a tenant that will stay for a long time,
collecting money from the tenants, trying to notice the tenants for something,
maintaing and fixing the house, finding people who can fix the house,
finding great real-estate agents, dealing with bad tenants, and etc.
If you observe them with more time, you'll get to see how hard it is to be a landlord.

## Tenants
How about the tenants?
From my experience, there's some things to be said.
When I find a place to rent, I normally go to a housing website where all the empty houses are.
Once I find a house that I like, I go and make a call to the real-estate agent.
The problem is, they always say "I'm sorry but that house is already rented out!", and I'm like, "scammed again".
There are a lot of listings that don't even exist and we actually have to call and check to see whether that house exists or not.
Okay, lets say that I actually found a house that I like and exists.
It's time for me to check whether that house is actually functional.
See whether the water pressure is nice, hot water comes out, lights are all functional, functional options(TV, fridge, etc.),
sunlight, floor heating system, and etc.
And that's just me.
I bet there are a ton lot more things to check for other people.
If anything on our own list doesn't work, we have to go back and search a house or try and get that fixed before you get in.
Even the paperwork for renting a house is tedious and time-consuming.
I have to go there in person and have to sign a document.
This, is only the start of this process.

Now let's get to the phase where you got all the signing done.
It's time to move in.
Yes, moving is really hard.
It has become easier because of the startups that give you easy access to moving companies.
We get a moving company to move, and it gets more expensive if you don't do the work, obviously.
But if you do the work, it's really painful and time-consuming.
Once you move in, you have to clean up everything in your new house.
Then you unpack your stuff and it seems like everything's back to normal.
Nope, you're not.
You have to know where to put the garbage out, find the places you needed like hospitals, restaurants, and etc.
Also see if there are any special rules that you have to follow.
You sort of see it on the entrance of your house or maybe your mailbox.
Okay, so now it feels like our home.
But what if something broke, like in my experience, the roof sat down and water came out from it.
I actually was terrified since it was at the middle of the night and I could've died because of electricity.
I got in touch with my landlord and it took a long time to fix it.
Which obviously was a very bad experience.
And when I want to get out of this house, I have to go on and do the house searching thing again.
Also there are times when you just can't live where you were and have to get out early.
It's even harder to get out.
You could also get in a fight with the landlord about the deposit.
And of course, the landlord might be a very bad person who doesn't care for their tenants.
Which is a really hard thing to get over.

## Problems between
Since I only have experience as a tenant and only have assumptions and observations of a landlord,
I pretty much just said everything about the tenant side, but not the landlord side.
The thing is, tenants and landlords have their own problems, but they also have problems between them.
For example, landlords want tenants who are kind, cares their house while they live, and follow the landlords rules.
On the other hand, tenants want to have landlords that have hospitality, maintain their houses nicely, and low rent price.

## Solution
Why not have a platform that does all the communication and work between the tenants and landlords?
For the tenants, just show them real houses that actually are available for rent, and give them all the information they need.
After that, make it way easier to actually rent that house. Sign the document online and send in the money right over.
The tenants will always need to pay, so why not pay it automatically with the maintenance cost.
Put in a nice community where the tenants can tell eachother tips about the neighborhood.
What places are better for what and stuff. 
Also make partnerships with moving companies and cleaning companies to make the tenant's life easier.
Maybe even automate garbage management.
When tenants need to leave fast, why not make it easier for them to find people who can replace them.
You can just request, and go, but of course this is what the real-estate agents do.
But finding a way to make that transaction instant is what I mean.

For landlords, why not sign the documents on your phone.
It'll be way easier and faster to just do it like that.
Why not have background checks for tenants?
See if they won't to any damage and have bad behavior.
Most landlords really needed that because there are a lot of people who come take a look at their house,
but a lot of tenants seem really bad in their eye.
On-demand handymen if the house needs to be fixed or maintained.
Finding nice real-estate agents of course, and all that linking.
Also make a nice interface for them to actually say things to their tenants.
Or maybe rent out their rooms on Airbnb!

## Conclusion
There sure are a lot of things to consider, but I think it will be a better world for both
tenants and landlords if it were like the solution.
A place where all the tenants and landlords are happy.
And where cleaning companies, moving companies, handymen companies, real-estate agents and even local stores get more traction!
