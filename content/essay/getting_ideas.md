Summary: What I studied to become a person who can think of ideas, whether good or bad.

# Getting Ideas
I thought starting a startup meant actually having the initial idea to act on.
But I was wrong.
Actually getting the idea is also the part of a startup.
Most successful companies didn't even know they'd become a company.
But the problem is, I wanted to start a startup.
Airbnb's origin story has a lot in common with me.
The founders just wanted to start a company.
And they did, except it took them a while to actually decide which idea to go with.
The same is happening to me too.
I started a company, and actually had an initial idea.
But for several reasons, we decided to go for a new idea.
Something that we all wanted and cared about.

## In Pursuit of Ideas
Every origin story of a great idea is pictured as if it just happened.
Most of those stories don't point out the whole picture.
The people in those stories actually spent a lot of time and effort for that idea.
It's extremely hard to get a 'good' idea, and it's even more harder to prove that idea is right.
I learend that if you want to think of good ideas, you have to teach yourself to.
Thinking up good ideas is actually a skill that can be practiced and learned.

## What I Learned
I'll just point down a list of what I learned.

* Live in the future and make something missing or interesting.
* Write an idea journal that has all of your thoughts, ideas, and problems that you experienced.
* Take a look at your journal and update your thoughts.
* Discuss your idea with anyone and with yourself(talk out loud!).
* Go take a walk(or anything else other than work) and think in the background.
* It's all about taking your mind unconscious to conscious.
* You have to generate a lot of ideas first, to actually have good or bad ones.
* A startup idea is: problem + solution + insight.
* Find a problem that you really care.
* Most importantly, give yourself plenty of time.
