Summary: The reasons why I started a startup. Help people massively, create value, and be evaluated by my performance.

# Why I Started a Startup
The trigger point of me getting into startups was [Y Combinator](https://www.ycombinator.com/).
It's an acceleration program that gives you seed money and a massive alumni network.
Companies from Y Combinator: Dropbox, Airbnb, Coinbase, Sprite, Cruise, GitLab, the list goes on.
One of the cofounders of Y Combinator was someone called Paul Graham.
He was famous for Lisp, Viaweb, [Hacker News](https://news.ycombinator.com/), and his essays.
When I started reading about startups in Paul Graham's [blog](http://paulgraham.com/), it was mind blowing.
I learned so much about wealth, money, how to do what I like, employment, and most importantly, startups.
So it was time for me to study about startups. That's when Y Combinator did something called [Startup School](https://www.startupschool.org/).
That course gave me the range of what I should know and study, so I went on reading blog posts, books, and etc.

After a time of study, I found the core reasons why I wanted to start a startup.

1. Help a lot of people.
2. Create value.
3. Get evaluated by my performance.

## Help a lot of people
I always liked helping people. 
I don't exactly know the reason why, but I always had this thought: "live kindly".
As life passed by, I started to like helping different types of people.
People who had problems that I could solve easily, in need of something that I can give, or trying but failing.
It's the "trying but failing" is what I like helping.
People who try deserve more than failure and deserve more opportunities.
I don't mean by getting jobs.
In a general manner, for instance, someone who's trying hard to open a jar but couldn't. 
So I give that someone a hand.
In the end we're both happy. That someone solved their problem, and I get some self good feeling!
So I wanted to feel more of that self good feeling in a massive scale.
I imagined a place where I solve so many problems that a lot of people save their time.
It was time for me to make that into a reality.

## Create value
Wealth is not the same as money.
Money is actually the middleman of every trade.
I didn't want to get carried away of how much I made, had, and could spend.
The thought of money is only there when I need to trade.
The biggest trade of what I want to do is studying at MIT.
Preparing and studying at a prestigous university costs a lot.
My first objective for money is just that.
But I didn't want to 'just' make money.
I wanted to create value.
Putting money before value will lead to greedy decisions, and it might also create unethical ones too.
Value is something that we can build. 
The more users that love what you do, the more value you'll build.
To me, helping people creates a lot of value.
Value will lead to money.

## Get evaluated by my performance
I have about 6 years of industry experience as a software engineer.
In those years, I've done a lot of cost reducement, optimizations, and built a lot of things.
But the problem is, if you're performance can't be measured in a global way, it's not easy to get a massive raise.
I was part of a product, instead of an independent sales person.
Bringing people just shows everyone that you brought them as a sales person.
But it's not easy to evaluate how much you did in being part of building a product.
As a founder/cofounder of a startup, you do the decision making, and also clean up your mess.
The more performant, the more value you'll be able to create.

## Conclusion
I wish to help people with all my heart, create value of what I do, and get evaluated by my peers and users and show my growth.
I've incorporated a company called `the behind Corp.` with my cofounders(Youngjun and Daegyun) and am trying to find a great problem to solve.
When we get to find a problem that we're passionate about, I'll write the origin story of this startup and problem.
