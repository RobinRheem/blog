Summary: Just my thoughts of how a futuristic house would look like. Putting in a lot of imagination!

# House of the Future
I thought house automation would've been the first thing to come because of the rise of IoT(Internet of Things).
But it still hasn't fully happened.
Not the things of what I think.
There are several things that we do in our house.
I'll talk one by one, and try to imagine a fully automated and futuristic house.

## Bedroom
I just think this would be the best place to start with since this is our most private space.
Also, a place that we start and end the day.
When I wake up, I wish to wake up in a really good state.
So the alarm would go when it's my optimal state of non-tiredness.
Even if I slept 2 hours, it'll wake me up when I'm not in the tired zone.
The lights will automatically be turned on, and the room temperature will be perfect.
Just the way I love it!
Then some kind of voice assistant will give me a nice summary of the day ahead.
My schedule, today's todo, the weather, and traffic conditions.
If I have the time, breakfast and a glass of water will be automatically served.
Then, the clothes that I have to wear will be nicely introduced in the wardrobe.
But before I take my clothes on, I'd better go get cleaned up!

## Bathroom
When I step into the bathroom, a toothbrush with some paste on it will be served.
I'll be brushing my teeth, or maybe I won't have to do it.
I really wish something that would brush my teeth automatically or something!
I'll go sit on the toilet and it'll flush automatically for what I throw in there.
With the samples of the things that I threw in, it'll check my health and give me a nice diagnosis.
It's time for a shower!
When I just go in the booth, it'll automatically fall down the temperature that I love.
The shampoo and body wash will come out and all I need to do is just rub it on me.
When I'm done, why not some towels just rub all the water out of me.
If everything's done, I'll go put on my clothes and get ready for work.

## Going out and back in
When I go out, all electricity will be dead to save energy.
I'll have a nice app that locks the door and also have a CCTV in front of the door.
It'll alert me when something's fishy!
Or maybe give a way to open the door when a guest came.

Once it gets near my arrival time, the house automatically cleans itself up and gets ready to match the temperature I want.
When I get in the house, a voice assistant will remind me the things that I needed to do at night.
Also, dinner's served!
I'll eat it and it'll clean for itself.
Then put my clothes into an automatic laundry machine that also just folds when it finishes.
It'll soon be my bedtime, and I'll just get my PJs on and go to sleep!

## Abstractions
I seem to have abstracted away a lot of things.
It's those abstractions that we'll need to implement in the future.
Automatic laundry, bathroom control, getting control of every component of the house, cleaning, and cooking.
It sort of makes me think of just getting a C-3PO to get all that done!
Hope these things can be automated in a architectural, systematic, or gadget-style way.
Gadget-style way to be precise because it won't be easy to tear down all the old houses.
The newer the houses, the more built-in automation it comes with.
